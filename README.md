The Joy of Painting ETL Project
Overview
In this project we are going to explore the idea of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), which is the process of taking data from multiple unique sources, modifying them in some way, and then storing them in a centralized database. This is a very common practice when collecting data from systems in order to utilize that data in another system. This data may come in the form of CSV, JSON, XML, API requests with other custom formats, etc - it might even be that you have direct access to several databases with different, but relatable data that you want to be merged into another database in order to gain insight from it in some way.
