# ETL: The Joy of Coding

## Project Context

In this project, we explore the concept of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). ETL is the process of taking data from multiple unique sources, modifying it, and then storing it in a centralized database. This practice is common when collecting data from various systems to utilize it in another system. The data can come in different formats like CSV, JSON, XML, API requests with other custom formats, etc. It might also involve merging data from several databases with different, but related data to gain insights.

## Presented Problem

Your local public broadcasting station has an overwhelming number of requests for information on The Joy of Painting. Viewers want a website that allows them to filter the 403 episodes based on the following criteria:

- **Month of original broadcast**: Useful for viewers who wish to watch paintings done during a specific month of the year.
- **Subject Matter**: Useful for viewers who wish to watch specific items being painted.
- **Color Palette**: Useful for viewers who wish to watch specific colors being used in a painting.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What ETL means and its importance.
- How to extract data from multiple sources.
- How to transform data to fit a centralized database schema.
- How to load data into a centralized database.
- How to design a database schema to support various filter criteria.
- How to build an API to support filtered queries.
- How to implement a web interface to utilize the API for data filtering.
